In Past times, good folks were wise to burn the bodies of evil wizards, lest their "essential fats" be eaten and consumed by grave worms and the like. As Lovecraft notes in "The Festival", such worms may be "instructed" and form corruption "horrid life springs". Which is to say, the consciousness of a dead wizard or witch could be consumed (when laid to rest) by worms, maggots, and other crawling things, imprinting the wizard's mind upon them and creating a new form of life intent on carrying on the ambitions of dead wizard. Thus, a crawling one is a union of such creatures, forming a human-like mass, able to disguise itself to pass as human and work its malign intent. The "ingested" will of the wizard effectively drives the mass to work collectively to perform deeds and actions.
